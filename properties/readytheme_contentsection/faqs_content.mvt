	<div class="faq-question" id="1-question">
		<span>1. What is the foaming agent in the soap?</span>
		<p>The foaming agent used is Laurel and it's organically derived from the coconut husk. It's stabalized with a fatty acid taken from the coconut husk called Ash of Dedecyl. 100% natural and is not processed. It is not releated to SLS, or the synthetic processed form of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) or Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES). For a more comprehensive review please read our newsletter article here: April 2005 - The high risk of beauty.</p>
		<p><strong>Sodium Lauryl (Laurel) Sulfate (SLS) or (SLES).</strong>
	Harsh detergents and wetting agents used in garage floor cleaners, engine degreasers and auto cleaning products. SLS is well known in the scientific community as a common skin irritant. It is rapidly absorbed and retained in the eyes, brain, heart and liver, which may result in harmful long-term effects. SLS could retard healing, cause cataracts in adults and keep children’s eyes from developing properly. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) recommend wearing self-contained breathing apparatus, rubber boots and chemical resistant gloves, safety goggles and chemical fume hoods while handling for personal protection.</p>

	<div class="faq-question" id="2-question">
		<span>2. Does Miracle II contain Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)?</span>
		<p>	Miracle II products are Organic in nature and DO NOT contain processed chemicals (SLS): sodium lauryl sulfate or (SLES): sodium lauryl ether sulfate. These industrial chemicals dry the skin by stripping the protective lipids from the cellular membrane so it can't effectively regulate moisture. Inside the lipids are the communications (electrical) channels the body relies on to receive and send vital information through-out the body. By destroying the lipids, those cells break down and can no longer receive proper instructions and eventually either will die, or start relaying incorrect communications to other cells in the body.</p>

		<span>22. What is Eloptic Energized Oxygenated Water?</span>
		<p>"Eloptic" was a word invented by Clayton Tedeton to be used in reference to the process in which he passes an electrical charge through the water molecules and tunes their frequency to vibrate at the same frequency as Aloe Vera molecules. Since this process was not commonly used 22 years ago... Clayton created the phrase called "Eloptically charged" to described to others what he was doing.

	Many of you have heard of ultrasonic cleaners used in the medical industry, and also dentistry to steralize utensils, this is a similar form of charging the water molecule, to a specific rate of frequency which in this case kills germs, disease, bacteria etc... In the case of Miracle II it's adding the frequency of Aloe Vera.</p>
