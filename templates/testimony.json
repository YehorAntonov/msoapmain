I am from Calhoun, Louisiana, and\r\n                  I would like to tell you how Miracle II, The Anointed Miracle\r\n                  Soap, came into being.<br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  First, I would like to say that God must be given all credit,\r\n                  all glory, and all praise for the Miracle II concept. It was\r\n                  He who gave me the formula for this amazing product, awakening\r\n                  me at 1:00 a.m. that July morning in 1980. Names of minerals\r\n                  with the formulas on how to mix them were all miraculously\r\n                  flashed on my bedroom wall.<br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  The name Miracle II is just that, it was my second miracle\r\n                  from God. My first miracle came when I was healed after\r\n                  watching a television evangelist point his finger at me and\r\n                  saying, \"There is a man out there that God is going to heal. \"\r\n                  I had spent nine months laid up from injuries I received in an\r\n                  auto accident. I believed the evangelist was speaking directly\r\n                  to me, I said out loud, \"If there is a God that this man is\r\n                  talking about, if you will let me live and finish raising my\r\n                  children, I'll do anything you want me to do.\" One day later I\r\n                  arose from my bed healed of all my injuries.<br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  At this time, I was a brick distributor and owned rental\r\n                  property. As the months went by, I began to hear this voice.\r\n                  It would say \"YOU PROMISED ME THAT YOU WOULD OBEY ME.\" For the\r\n                  next two years, this voice became so loud and often that the\r\n                  only thing I knew to do was to run away. So, I got in my motor\r\n                  home and ran away. I roamed the United States and Mexico for 8\r\n                  years, trying to get lost, I stayed away from home up to 10\r\n                  months each year.<br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  Every place I traveled in the U.S. or Mexico, someone would\r\n                  come up to me and would tell me that God loved me.<br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  After 8 years of this, I was in Union City, Tennessee,\r\n                  December 1980, and I said to myself that I would go back home\r\n                  and face whatever I've got to do. After being back a few\r\n                  weeks, I was talking to God and He was talking to me. My wife\r\n                  would hear me talking and would ask, \"Clayton, what in the\r\n                  world is going on?\" And I would tell her, \"I don't know, I\r\n                  cannot explain to you what is happening in my life.\"<br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  A short time after coming back home, I talked to God and He\r\n                  said, \"I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING THAT EVERY PERSON THAT\r\n                  I HAVE CREATED ON THIS EARTH WILL NEED, AND AS LONG AS YOU\r\n                  GIVE ME THE GLORY, YOU WILL PROSPER AND SEE MY GLORY.\"<br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  One day later at 1:00 a.m. the formulation for Miracle II was\r\n                  miraculously flashed on my bedroom wall. The days following\r\n                  this I began to assemble and mix this product. The voice of\r\n                  God told me that to name it and how to package it.<br>\r\n                  <div align=\"center\"></div>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  As time passed and all this time the voice of the Lord was\r\n                  saying, \"IT'S TIME TO GO TO WORK.\" At this time, I did not\r\n                  know exactly what to do. In December 1980, I talked to the\r\n                  Lord and said, \"I have got to have instructions so that this\r\n                  product can be used.\" A day later the Lord instructed me to\r\n                  take some of this product to a woman and tell her to use it\r\n                  for everything. I did not know the lady at this time.<br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  <div align=\"center\">\r\n                    <a style=\"color: #259484;\" href=\"https://miraclesoap.mivatest.com/disclaimer.html\">Click here</a> to view\r\n                    <b>Product Disclaimer</b>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  After three days, she called me and said, \"Every time I use\r\n                  this product, the strangest things happen to me, I'm going to\r\n                  have to pray about this.\" On the 17th day of April 1982 at\r\n                  9:00 a.m., the lady called me and said, \"Mr. Tedeton, for the\r\n                  last two months the Lord has instructed me to write a set of\r\n                  instructions for that product that you brought me. When can\r\n                  you come and pick them up?\"<br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  That day I picked up the instructions and that same day the\r\n                  voice (which I know to have been God), said \"YOU CAN RECEIVE\r\n                  WHAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS DESIRED - CONTENTMENT AND PEACE IN YOUR\r\n                  SOUL.\" I said \"Where?\" The voice said, \"GO TO THE CHURCH ON\r\n                  TOP OF THE HILL.\" I went and when the preacher gave the alter\r\n                  call, I froze. Just seconds before he quit calling for\r\n                  sinners, I stood up and the voice of the Lord said to me\r\n                  \"Scream Jesus\". I ran to the alter screaming loudly, \"God save\r\n                  me! I am a sinner, I believe that Jesus is the son of God.\r\n                  Don't let me go to Hell!\"<br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  That day, April 18 at 12:00 noon, 1982, the greatest thing\r\n                  that can ever happen to a man happened to me. I accepted Jesus\r\n                  as my Savior. That night, I got my daughter's little white\r\n                  Bible down. I opened it up to St. John. I said, \"God let me\r\n                  understand what your word really means.\" A bolt of lightning\r\n                  suddenly shot through the ceiling where I was sitting and lit\r\n                  up the room like the bright lights of a hospital operating\r\n                  room, the voice that had been speaking to me all along, said\r\n                  \"READ MY WORD AND ACCEPT IT FOR WHAT I SAY.\" The words\r\n                  literally came off each page, entered through my eyes, and\r\n                  into my spirit. This happened almost all that night. I was\r\n                  actually eating the word of God.<br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  As the weeks went by, God began to open doors for people to\r\n                  use the different products. I gave it away for about 5 years,\r\n                  then in 1987, I began to bottle and sell it for the first\r\n                  time.<br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  God started sending people to me, telling me of the healing\r\n                  merits of both the SOAP and the NEUTRALIZER. Skin cancers\r\n                  being healed were the first healings I heard about from my\r\n                  customers. Then, other healing reports began to come in;\r\n                  Psoriasis, warts, poison ivy, bedsores, athletes foot, and\r\n                  many other skin problems. In this way, little by little, the\r\n                  many products uses became known, many people were saying the\r\n                  SPIRIT of God told them to use the product in a certain way.\r\n                  Customers began to tell me how they used it to kill fire ants,\r\n                  roaches, spiders, fleas, ticks, and many other insects. God\r\n                  has revealed that this product, once it becomes known, will\r\n                  revolutionize CLEANING and will be the answer to HEALTH\r\n                  PROBLEMS, and it will also be a miracle in AGRICULTURE. It\r\n                  will also be the means of employment for people everywhere,\r\n                  thousands of people are selling Miracle II nationwide at this\r\n                  time and giving the glory to God.<br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  As I think about all that has gone on up till now, when the\r\n                  voice of the Lord would say to me \"YOU PROMISED ME THAT YOU\r\n                  WOULD OBEY ME, AND IT'S TIME TO GO TO WORK,\" I now understand\r\n                  what the work is to preach the gospel of Jesus, demonstrating\r\n                  the power of God in healing, blessing and deliverance, and\r\n                  inspiring God's people to be doers of the word, not just\r\n                  hearers. As of this date (January 1, 2001), God has made it\r\n                  possible for me to tell about Miracle II nationwide and to\r\n                  people in 26 countries. The Lord has changed my professions\r\n                  from a rental property owner and brick distributor and has\r\n                  made me a BEARER OF GOOD NEWS and has given me a MASTERS\r\n                  DEGREE in SPIRITUAL CHEMISTRY, MEDICINE, NERVOLOGY and\r\n                  AGRICULTURE for the equipping of the saints, for the work of\r\n                  the ministry, for the building up of the body of Christ.<br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  Because it is God's will that we live in health, have a sound\r\n                  mind, prosper and go about doing good.<br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  Clayton Tedeton, Gods Faithful Servant<br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  <a style=\"color: #259484;\" href=\"https://miraclesoap.mivatest.com/catgeory-display-ctgy.html\">Click here</a>\r\n                  to learn more about Miracle II products. <br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n                  <a style=\"color: #259484;\" href=\"https://miraclesoap.mivatest.com/disclaimer.html\">Click here</a> to view\r\n                  <b>Product Disclaimer</b>\r\n</font>"
